## 2026-06-22 · Activation and First-Use Friction

### User Chat Inputs

| Time Context | User Message | What It Reveals |
|---|---|---|
| After workspace cleanup | “reading-notes这个folder作为personal里的project子文件夹里的一个下级文件夹，这个是自己做着好玩的；现在针对 https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/YZgBZW6589GIjsOvYUZ1fg 这个文章，在帮我起用下这个阅读插件” | User expects the extension to be easy to activate for a specific WeChat article, and expects reading notes to be treated as a personal side project. |
| After opening extension | “不行，打开这个extension显示无法访问您的文件 该文件可能已被移至别处、修改或删除。ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND” | The extension breaks when its local unpacked-extension path changes. Current UX gives a browser-level file error, not an actionable extension-level fix. |
| After path symlink fix | “再来一次” | User wants a one-shot retry / relaunch flow, not a multi-step manual explanation every time. |
| After extension launches | “OK，这个页面现在根据我的chat应该优化，请记录一个log文件去记录我提的chat内容是哪些，哪些可以被识别成该优话的交互，进一步升级这个extension” | User wants chats to be converted into product iteration logs and upgrade requirements. The extension project needs an explicit feedback-to-backlog loop. |

## Identified Interaction Problems

### 1. Local Extension Path Is Fragile

**Observed behavior**
- The extension was originally loaded from `~/workspace/wechat-reader-extension-stable`.
- Workspace cleanup moved it to `~/workspace/wechat-reader-extension`.
- Chrome still remembered the old unpacked-extension path and showed `ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND`.

**Product implication**
- Unpacked Chrome extensions are path-sensitive.
- If the project folder is moved, the browser gives a generic file-not-found error.
- The user should not have to understand symlinks or extension internals.

**Upgrade idea**
- Add a `SETUP.md` / in-extension setup note explaining the stable install path.
- Keep a stable symlink path:
  - `~/workspace/wechat-reader-extension-stable`
  - points to `~/workspace/wechat-reader-extension`
- Add a visible “If extension fails after folder cleanup” troubleshooting section.

**Priority**
- P0 for local usability.

---

### 2. No First-Run / Reload Guidance

**Observed behavior**
- The assistant had to repeatedly tell the user:
  1. Open `chrome://extensions`
  2. Enable Developer Mode
  3. Load unpacked extension
  4. Select extension folder
  5. Reload extension
  6. Return to WeChat article
  7. Click extension icon

**Product implication**
- First-run setup is too procedural and not encoded anywhere in the project.
- The extension assumes it is already installed and working.

**Upgrade idea**
- Create `SETUP.md` with exact local install steps.
- Add this text to `REBUILD_PROMPT.md` so future rebuilds include setup guidance.
- Add an options-page “Setup / Troubleshooting” section:
  - current provider status
  - current active provider
  - supported page status: `mp.weixin.qq.com`
  - reload instructions

**Priority**
- P1.

---

### 3. Article-Specific Launch Is Not Smooth Enough

**Observed behavior**
- User gave a specific article URL and expected the plugin to be activated for that article.
- Current extension only works after user manually opens the article and clicks extension icon.

**Product implication**
- The “activate for this article” flow is still browser-operation-heavy.
- For repeat use, the desired workflow is: paste URL / open article / analyze.

**Upgrade idea**
- Add side panel field: “Analyze current tab” with clearer state.
- Add optional input field in side panel: paste WeChat article URL, then open/analyze.
- Add a browser action behavior that:
  - opens side panel
  - checks whether current tab is supported
  - if unsupported, shows a button to open target WeChat URL or explains exact next step.

**Priority**
- P1.

---

### 4. Error Messages Are Browser-Level, Not Product-Level

**Observed behavior**
- User saw Chrome’s `ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND`, which did not explain the real cause: unpacked extension path had moved.
- Current extension also only returns generic errors like “Open a WeChat article first” or API errors.

**Product implication**
- The tool needs friendly, specific diagnosis for the most common failure modes:
  - extension path moved
  - content script not injected
  - not on `mp.weixin.qq.com`
  - provider API key missing
  - provider request failed
  - article extraction returned empty content

**Upgrade idea**
- Add a `diagnostics` message in `background.js`.
- Add a diagnostics panel in `sidepanel.html`:
  - page URL
  - article extraction status
  - active provider
  - API key configured yes/no
  - last error
- Make error copy action-oriented:
  - “This looks like the extension folder moved. Reload it from chrome://extensions.”
  - “This page is not a WeChat article. Open mp.weixin.qq.com article first.”
  - “No API key configured. Open Settings → choose provider → save key.”

**Priority**
- P1.

---

### 5. Reading Notes Are Not Integrated With Personal Knowledge Folder

**Observed behavior**
- User explicitly classified `reading-notes` as a personal side project.
- Current extension saves notes only in `chrome.storage.local`.
- Export is manual Markdown download.

**Product implication**
- Saved notes are trapped in browser storage unless exported.
- User’s desired long-term home is now:
  - `~/workspace/reading-notes/`

**Upgrade idea**
- Short term: add export naming convention and instructions to save into reading-notes.
- Medium term: add a native helper script outside the extension to import exported Markdown into `reading-notes`.
- Long term: use Chrome File System Access API where available to let user choose a local notes folder and write Markdown directly.

**Priority**
- P2.

---

### 6. Feedback Should Become Product Backlog Automatically

**Observed behavior**
- User asked to record chat content and identify which parts can become extension improvements.

**Product implication**
- The project needs a lightweight product feedback loop.

**Upgrade idea**
- Maintain this `INTERACTION_LOG.md`.
- Add a `BACKLOG.md` with status fields:
  - `P0/P1/P2`
  - `Problem`
  - `Evidence from chat`
  - `Proposed change`
  - `Status`
- When the user says “这个页面应该优化” or reports friction, append a dated entry here before changing code.

**Priority**
- P1.

## Current Stable Paths

| Purpose | Path |
|---|---|
| Extension source | `~/workspace/wechat-reader-extension/extension` |
| Stable Chrome unpacked-extension path | `~/workspace/wechat-reader-extension-stable` |
| Personal reading notes | `~/workspace/reading-notes` |
| Test article | `https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/YZgBZW6589GIjsOvYUZ1fg` |

---

## Next Recommended Implementation Order

1. Add `SETUP.md` and update `REBUILD_PROMPT.md` with stable local setup.
2. Add a diagnostics state in side panel:
   - current tab URL
   - supported page yes/no
   - article extracted yes/no
   - active provider
   - API key configured yes/no
3. Improve error messages for missing API key, unsupported page, and empty article extraction.
4. Add `BACKLOG.md` so future chat-derived improvements have a clean tracking surface.
5. Later: improve note export/import into `personal/projects/reading-notes`.

## 2026-06-22 · Automatic Log Prompt and Optimization Flow

### User Chat Inputs

| Time Context | User Message | What It Reveals |
|---|---|---|
| After confirming chat expectations can be captured | “你建立一个自动问询，是否记录到阅读插件log吧。之后对于这个小插件有一个自动化的优化流程” | User wants future plugin-related feedback to trigger an explicit capture question, and wants a repeatable optimization workflow rather than ad hoc fixes. |

### Interaction Rule Added

Workspace rule added to `<work-hub>/AGENTS.md`:

> When the user mentions the WeChat reading plugin, ask whether to record it to the reading plugin log and convert it into a backlog item.

### Product Process Added

- `BACKLOG.md` created for prioritized plugin improvements.
- `OPTIMIZATION_WORKFLOW.md` created for the feedback-to-implementation loop.

### Backlog Impact

- WR-007 tracks the product-feedback loop itself.
- Future plugin feedback should follow:

```text
chat feedback → interaction log → backlog → implementation → reload extension → verify on a real WeChat article
```

## 2026-06-24 · GitHub Repository and README Consolidation

### User Chat Inputs

| Time Context | User Message | What It Reveals |
|---|---|---|
| After building local extension workflow | “我在本地的wechat-reader-extension看下怎么链接到我的GitHub仓库里去，如果不能上传你可以用我的浏览器权限去在网页操作我的GitHub，主要是沉淀read_me和实际这个小插件怎么做” | User wants the local extension project connected to GitHub, with a clear README explaining what the extension does, how to install it, how to recover from path issues, and how future product iteration should work. |
| After first GitHub upload | “上传了，但是你现在结构也太乱了，根本看不明白，能不能梳理清楚” | Repository needs a clearer information architecture: root should be the entry point, process/history documents should move into a docs folder, and README should make the structure self-evident. |
| Same cleanup request | “然后read me x中英双语” | README should be bilingual so both Chinese-first personal workflow and English GitHub readers can understand the plugin. |

### Product / Repository Implication

- The extension already has a GitHub remote: `https://github.com/<owner>/wechat-reader-extension.git`.
- The repository initially lacked a `README.md`, making the project hard to understand from GitHub.
- The first documentation pass left too many operational files in the root directory, making the repo visually noisy.
- Setup instructions should document the stable local path and Chrome unpacked-extension workflow.

### Backlog Impact

- WR-001 and WR-002 are addressed by setup guidance under `docs/SETUP.md`.
- WR-008 is addressed by adding a bilingual root `README.md`, moving process documents under `docs/`, and pushing the cleaned structure to GitHub.

## 2026-06-24 · Core Reading Workflow and Comment Revision

### User Chat Inputs

| Time Context | User Message | What It Reveals |
|---|---|---|
| After README cleanup | “下一步重点不是继续堆功能，而是改善使用体验：更清晰的首次安装引导 / 更具体的错误诊断 / 更顺畅的‘打开文章 → 识别 → 分析’流程 / 更好地把导出的笔记沉淀到个人 reading-notes 文件夹” | User wants the plugin optimized around the main reading workflow, not feature sprawl. |
| Same request | “我的下载文件夹里有一个html-comment-skiil你也可以参考那个思路，去思考我的这个extension怎么能够更好的支持多轮交互，我提一些comment你怎么优化输出？” | User wants comments to become structured feedback that can revise the output, similar to html-comment's comment-processing loop. |

### Product Implication

- The extension should not auto-jump from page open to AI generation without making extraction status visible.
- Errors should explain what failed and what to do next.
- Chat is not enough for output improvement; the user needs a comment-to-revision workflow.
- Markdown export should use stable reading-notes naming so local automation can ingest it later.

### Implementation Added

- Added explicit `识别当前文章 → 开始分析` flow.
- Added more specific unsupported-page, empty-content, missing-key, and API/network error guidance.
- Added `Optimize with Comment`, storing applied comments per article and regenerating the six-section analysis.
- Added current-note Markdown export with `reading-notes/YYYY-MM-DD-title.md` naming.

### Backlog Impact

- WR-003, WR-004, WR-005, WR-006 moved to Verify.
- WR-009 added for comment-driven output revision.

## 2026-06-24 · Output Philosophy: Core Points, Synthesized Insights, Reader Value

### User Chat Inputs

| Time Context | User Message | What It Reveals |
|---|---|---|
| After trying the improved workflow direction | “OK，我有一个整体的修改意见：always 更讲清楚核心要点，insight而不是输出结构，光了解结构没有意义，现在的insight讲的很散乱。其次在思考输出文章内容的时候，思考读者的视角，这个文章对什么样的人分别有什么样的价值” | The default analysis should move away from outline-style article structure and toward a reader-useful interpretation: core points, fewer but stronger insights, and value by reader type. |

### Product Implication

- `Article Structure` is not a high-value default section for this reading assistant.
- `Key Insights` should synthesize patterns, implications, and decision lenses instead of listing scattered facts.
- The assistant should explicitly ask: useful to whom, and for what decision or action?

### Implementation Added

- Replaced the visible `Article Structure` section with `Core Points`.
- Added `Reader Value`.
- Updated the system prompt so every analysis prioritizes substance over outline.
- Updated Markdown export and rebuild prompt to preserve the new output model.

### Backlog Impact

- WR-010 added and moved to Verify.

## 2026-06-24 · Source-Linked Excerpts and Cleaner Repository Homepage

### User Chat Inputs

| Time Context | User Message | What It Reveals |
|---|---|---|
| After GitHub upload | “这个仓库首页只能是现在的逻辑分层了吗，一眼看上去很多不知所云的文件” | Repository root should be an understandable product entry point, not a flat dump of extension source files. |
| Same iteration | “这个reader，有没有可能有一些核心摘录和能针对性指向文章某个部分的能力” | Reader output should preserve evidence and let the user jump from AI interpretation back to the original article section. |

### Product Implication

- Move extension runtime files under `extension/` so GitHub root shows only `README.md`, `extension/`, and `docs/`.
- Add paragraph-level source references so insights can be checked against original text.

### Implementation Added

- Moved Chrome extension files into `extension/`.
- Updated stable local path to point `~/workspace/wechat-reader-extension-stable` at `.../wechat-reader-extension/extension`.
- Content script now extracts paragraph ids.
- Analysis output now includes `Core Excerpts`.
- `[P#]` references in the side panel are clickable and scroll the original WeChat article to the matching paragraph.

### Backlog Impact

- WR-011 added and moved to Verify.

## 2026-06-24 · API Key Auto-Save, Language Rules, and Reusable Preferences

### User Chat Inputs

| Time Context | User Message | What It Reveals |
|---|---|---|
| After reading workflow changes | “阅读插件这里，是的请帮我继续完成Core Excerpts 的引用定位再做顺一点 - reading-notes 的自动沉淀继续稳定 - 你的 comment 变成可复用的输出优化规则，而不是一次性反馈。以及我目前输入的API key帮我自动保存，不要每次都重新输入一次key；接下来语言输出规则上，中文文章输出中文，英文文章输出中英双文” | The extension should behave more like a durable reader system: source-linked excerpts, stable note capture, persistent user preferences, and language-aware output. |

### Product Implication

- `Core Excerpts` should feel like source navigation, not just another bullet list.
- Settings should persist automatically once the user types a key.
- Comments should seed standing preferences when they are clearly policy-like.
- Article language should drive prompt behavior.

### Implementation Added

- API key/model/base URL edits in the settings page now auto-save.
- `Core Excerpts` got a click hint and `P#` buttons that jump back to source paragraphs.
- English articles now trigger bilingual output; Chinese articles stay Chinese-first.
- Reusable standing rules are loaded from storage and injected into future analysis/chat prompts.

### Backlog Impact

- WR-012 and WR-013 added and moved to Verify.

## 2026-06-24 · Click-Selected Excerpts Persist as Core Excerpts

### User Chat Inputs

| Time Context | User Message | What It Reveals |
|---|---|---|
| After reviewing the latest extension | “关于Core Excerpts，有没有可能让读者去点击页面上部分内容，然后沉淀为一条Core Excerpts” | The excerpt flow should be driven from the source article itself, not only from AI-generated summaries. |

### Product Implication

- A selected excerpt should be persisted per article, not just appended to the current UI state.
- The same article should reuse its own excerpt list on reopen instead of duplicating entries.

### Implementation Added

- `content.js` now sends selected text plus article URL to the background.
- `background.js` stores selections under `selectedExcerpts:<articleUrl>` and broadcasts updates.
- `sidepanel.js` loads existing selected excerpts when an article is analyzed and merges them into `Core Excerpts` without duplicates.
- A toast confirms the excerpt was added.

### Backlog Impact

- WR-014 added and moved to Verify.

## 2026-06-24 · Excerpt Notes, Edit, and Delete

### User Chat Inputs

| Time Context | User Message | What It Reveals |
|---|---|---|
| After excerpt capture became stable | “在add excerpt的时候我能不能直接加note？这样可以让我的note和原文对应” | The excerpt flow should bind the user’s note to the exact source paragraph at capture time. |
| Same iteration | “OK当我不小心重新打开这个文章然后add了同一段作为excerpt时不再加入我的note里” | Repeated adds for the same excerpt should be idempotent; they should not duplicate or mutate the existing note unless explicitly edited. |
| Follow-up | “好的，你把这个也坐上” | The side panel should let the user maintain excerpt notes directly after capture. |

### Product Implication

- Excerpts need to behave like durable source-linked records, not transient UI state.
- Editing and deleting should be explicit actions on the saved excerpt, not side effects of re-adding it.

### Implementation Added

- `userExcerpt` now supports an optional note at capture time.
- Duplicate excerpt capture is idempotent and will not overwrite an existing note.
- `Core Excerpts` now render as cards with source-linked notes.
- `Edit note` and `Delete` actions update excerpt storage directly.
- Markdown note export now serializes excerpts from structured data instead of reading the rendered UI text.

### Backlog Impact

- WR-015 added and moved to Verify.

## 2026-07-02 — 集中验收 Session（文章：《关于 AI-Native 组织的思考》）

### Chat Evidence

| Context | User Original Words | Observed Problem / Signal |
|---|---|---|
| 验收步骤 1–4 | “1234都验证了没问” | 侧栏识别、中文输出/Core Points、[P#] 跳转、点选摘录+note 编辑删除全部通过 |
| 验收步骤 5 | “改了model名字，显示auto-saveuto-save” | 设置页自动保存生效，但状态提示文字渲染叠字（疑似 options.js:34-43 'Saving…'/'Auto-saved ✓' 竞态或重复渲染） |
| 验收步骤 6 | “不想尝试错误key，这个之后报错再说” | WR-004/005 保持 Verify，等真实报错场景再验 |
| 验收步骤 7 | “尝试的结果有点一般，我的反馈是：把洞察延伸成一些补充建议” | 批注重生成机制跑通，但输出把泛化建议塞进 Key Insights：建议无 [P#] 锚点、不贴合读者身份、混淆了 section 语义 |
| 历史笔记 | “不是第一条，我之前也有过note，记得都收录好” | Downloads 中 7 份历史导出已全量归集至 personal/projects/reading-notes/（阿里文 5 个迭代版本去重后保留 4+主版本） |

### Product Implication

- 批注重生成（WR-009）需要 section 语义约束：延伸类批注应生成独立小节（如 Action Ideas），不应改写 Key Insights 本体；新增内容需带 [P#] 锚点并贴合读者画像。
- 分析结果需按 URL 缓存，重开不重跑（省 API、秒开）。

### Backlog Impact

- WR-003/006/009/010/011/012/013/014/015 → Done。
- 新增 WR-016（auto-save 状态叠字）、WR-017（批注重生成质量）、WR-018（分析结果缓存）。

### Implementation Added (2026-07-02, same session)

- WR-016: `saveProviderKey` now cancels pending debounce and status-clear timers before writing; `scheduleAutoSave` clears the stale clear-timer. Status text can no longer overlap.
- WR-017: comment classification (CORRECTION / STYLE / EXTENSION / AMBIGUOUS) with section-contract rules; EXTENSION comments write into a new dedicated `ACTION IDEAS` section ([P#]-anchored, reader-profile-aware, consultant-cliché ban) and leave Key Insights untouched.
- Reader Profile: new options-page field (auto-saved, default profile pre-written from owner's context: LatAm fintech PM + AI-native workflow builder + personal-IP creator); injected into every analysis, comment regeneration, and Reader Value.
- WR-018: analysis cached per URL in `chrome.storage.local` (`analysis:<url>`); reopening an analyzed article renders instantly from cache with a toast; new ⟳ button in article bar forces re-analysis; Apply Comment updates the cache.
- Export/save paths (side panel + options bulk export) now include Action Ideas.

### Implementation Added (2026-07-02, Phase 1: multi-platform capture)

- content.js refactored to a `SITE_ADAPTERS` architecture (wechat / xhs); WeChat selectors preserved verbatim; adding a platform = one adapter + one manifest match.
- XHS adapter: title/author/date/desc with layered selector fallbacks and og: meta last resort; carousel image collection with CDN-param dedupe; video-note detection; image/video-only notes proceed with title+media instead of erroring.
- Excerpt selection now boots on any supported platform via the adapter's content element.
- Analysis payload carries `platform / platformLabel / images[] / isVideo`; text-only analyses explicitly tell the model images exist but are not provided (anti-hallucination guard until WR-020).
- Note export gains platform + `## Images` ([IMG#] URL list) for the future content library.
- manifest 1.1.0: xiaohongshu.com content script match; platform-aware detection and error copy in side panel.

### Implementation Added (2026-07-03, rename + Phase 2 multimodal)

- Renamed to Reader AI (manifest / side panel / options / README / SETUP); repo name kept for history.
- Excerpt fix: content element resolved per-selection instead of once at boot — ✦ Add Excerpt now appears on XHS SPA note pages and survives DOM re-renders.
- WR-020 multimodal: images fetched in the side panel, downscaled to ≤1024px JPEG, sent as base64 blocks (Anthropic & OpenAI-compat wire formats); capped at 6 images.
- `[IMG#]` citation system parallel to `[P#]`: live images tagged `data-wrai-image` at extraction, amber pill buttons in analysis, click scrolls the page to the image with highlight.
- 图文分析 toggle in detected state — default ON for Xiaohongshu (image-first), OFF for WeChat long-form; label shows image cap and token-cost hint.
- Text-only analyses keep the anti-hallucination notice; chat/comment flows stay text-only to save tokens.

### Follow-up Fixes (2026-07-03, image cap + provider vision)

- User: “为什么默认选择了前X张图，在我有Y张图的情况下” → cap raised 6→12; >6 images auto-downscale to 768px to bound token cost; toggle label now honest: “全部 Y 张” or “前 12/Y 张（成本上限截断）”.
- User: “用的是deepseek的API key为什么识别不了图片” → DeepSeek chat API has no image input. Added provider vision-capability detection (`supportsVision` in background): non-vision providers get a disabled toggle with an explicit reason + suggested switch; re-analyze path double-checks and degrades to text-only with a toast instead of failing silently. Aligns with the Model Transparency collaboration rule (2026-07-03).
